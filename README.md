As a user I should be presented with a screen where I can read the directions for the quiz

I should then be able to click "Begin Quiz" and start with my quiz 

   - get the begin quiz id and assign that value to a new variable using Vanilla Javascript or Jquery 
   - get the ids of question element and answers element and assign those values to their respective new variables 
   - create a click event for begin quiz where after clicking the questions container should unhide the questions and the 4 answer options 

Once the quiz starts I should see the timer (timer should be set to 60 secs)

I should then be presented with the first question and four answer options to choose from 

I should then be able to click the answer that I choose and get to know whether my answer is correct or wrong  

If I choose the right answer, system should say correct

If I choose a wrong answer, system should say wrong and substract 3 secods from the timer

Once done with the first question I should be able to click "Next Question"

I should be able to follow line 5 to 9 for the next 4 questions (total 5 questions to be answered within 60 secs)

If the timer goes up (i.e. 60 secs finished) or if I am able to finish answering all questions -
